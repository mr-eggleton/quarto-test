                easy to set up
                a client thats turned off will take the resources with them
            Virtual Network
                Software that runs on physical network hardware dividing it up
                Virtual Local Area Network
                    Staff and Student networks have different resource access
                    Improves security by separating computers
                Virtual Private Network
                    Encrypts traffic so only the computers inside the VPN can access messages and resources
